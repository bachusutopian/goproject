## The last version of our trial was matrix_with_tcp_final.go. We did almost everything but we cannot pass the two matrix to the multiplication function.
### The old version is matrix_with_tcp_final_old.go. In this version we did everything, but the client enters the parameters of the matrix in the Terminal, not in a separeted file. 
#### There is a screenshot for the old version as an example on how the matrix parameters should be entered. 
#### I also added a short report for the old version.
